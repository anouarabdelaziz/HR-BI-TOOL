a django app that let the HR managers create job offers, receive cadidates application. and it let them visualize candidates profil and qualifications in a descending order(most relevante profils to the job offer)
based on a weighted somme of qualifications and years of experience. i've tried to add some nlp technics to add more relevancy to the classification with no luck due to the highly
unstructured data that is coming from CVs(it can only make 
the difference between a web dev and a musician for exemple)
